# JDM Car Search

## **Overview:**
### Scraps multiple web sites for cars I'm looking for. Nothing to big hopefully. I don't want to spend too much time on this. :P

Uses chromium driver and Selenium to do all the heavy lifting


> ## TODO
>> - Images appear in terminal (*Assuming you have a terminal that can output unicode...*)
>> - Syntax should hopefully be (image, car_name, car_make, car_model, price, year, mileage, rating, etc.)
>> - Should grab information from multiple different websites

### **NOTE: WIP, I just started using selenium a week ago, don't expect much from this**
